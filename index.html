                    The Jataka tales are a voluminous body of literature native to India concerning the previous births of Gautama Buddha in both human and animal form. The future Buddha may appear as a king, an outcast, a god, an elephant—but, in whatever form, he exhibits some virtue that the tale thereby inculcates.

                    Tenali Rama was a Telugu poet and advisor in the court of King Krishnadevaraya, in what is now known as Andhra Pradesh. He was also known as the court jester because of his witty and humorous stories. Tenali Rama had a penchant for solving issues using his intelligence and values, and hence, his stories make for great bedtime stories for kids.

These mythological stories have been passed down since the early 16th century. More recently they’ve seen a revival which is all thanks to the animated series by Cartoon Network (India) called ‘The Adventures of Tenali Raman.’ The success of the show and his stories led to spin-offs like the animated series Rajguru Aur Tenaliram which was aired on Star Utsav and is now available on YouTube.

Nothing can beat the charm of reading these stories, which is why we wanted to shortlist our favourite Tanali Raman short stories for you. If your kids love problem-solving moral stories, then they’re going to enjoy listening to these Tenali Raman stories in English.
